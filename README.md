# NANOG 82 Hackathon Project

## Goals
I wasn't sure how much time I would have, and I was working alone, so I set goals of learning at least a little bit about:
- Containerlab
- Virtual Arista and Nokia images
- GNMI and pygnmi

Based on these, I came up with some simple project goals to be accomplished as time permitted:
- Install NetBox or Nautobot container in containerlab
- Create source of truth data in NetBox/Nautobot
- Create a Python script to update interface descriptions based on source of truth data, using NetBox/Nautobot and GNMI APIs.
